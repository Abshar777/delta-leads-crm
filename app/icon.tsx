/**
 * The Delta "d" on the app's own blue.
 *
 * The mark is drawn as SVG with the same geometry as the wordmark's `d`: a
 * full-height stem, a ring for the bowl, and the accent dot on the bowl's left.
 * An earlier version built it from positioned divs and satori's box model put a
 * gap between the stem and the bowl — it read as "ol", not a d.
 *
 * The dot is a flat teal rather than the wordmark's gradient. At 32 pixels a
 * gradient is one colour anyway, and `defs` is the part of SVG satori is least
 * reliable about.
